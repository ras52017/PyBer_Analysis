##Overview of the Analysis
•	This analysis is to create a DataFrame of the rid-sharing data by city type. The results of the analysis are presented using a multiple line graph that shows the weekly fares for each type of city using Pandas and Matplotlib. 

##Results
The results of this analysis show that:
•	The Average Fare per Driver in Rural cities is about three times that of Urban cites and a little over two times that of Suburban cities.
•	Urban cities generated the most rides with a total of 1625 rides while the Rural cities generated the least number of rides.
•	Rural population averagely pays about $10 more than the population in the Urban cities and about $4 more than those in the Suburban cities

##Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1.	The end of the third week of February seems to be the week with the highest total fare for all three cities. The company therefore has the potential of   racking in some profits.
2.	The fourth week in February also saw a decline in fares for all three cities which can be attributed to the decline.
